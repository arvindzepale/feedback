Your task is to implement a feedback modal (or "popup"), which opens when the button is clicked. The final implementation should meet the following criteria:



The modal should contain a title with the text: "Send us your feedback"
The modal should contain a subtitle with the text: "Your feedback is important to us, as it helps us to improve the application"
The modal should contain a text area with placeholder text: "Enter feedback here..."
The modal should contain a button with the text "Submit", which when clicked will close the modal, and add the feedback to the list of collected feedback.
The list of collected feedback should be displayed as a list on the page.
The contents of the page behind the modal should dim when the modal is open
The modal should close when the dimmed area outside is clicked
The modal and background dimming should have a fade animation when opening and closing
The modal should be center aligned vertically and horizontally within the browser window
The modal should be visually pleasing (consider fonts, colors, positioning, sizing, alignments etc.)


For an example of the sort of thing we're looking for, check out this modal implementation from bootstrap.
